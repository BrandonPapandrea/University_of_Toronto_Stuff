\newpage

The following is based on lecture notes taken during the Winter 2026 offering of MAT449 - Algebraic Curves, at the University of Toronto. While there is no set textbook used, some recommended readings for the course include \textit{Algebraic Curves} by Fulton, \textit{Lectures on Riemann Surfaces} by Forston, \textit{Equations over Finite Fields} by Schmidt. The notes are broken up in sections based on the week they were taught, and not necessarily broken up based on the textbook chapters. The intention is for these notes to be a polished version of my own lecture notes that allows me to revise and look over the material multiple times, and thus should not be considered a primary source for learning about this topic.
